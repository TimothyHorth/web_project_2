# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Emphasized asterisks by coloring them red
- Provided a unique check image when the checkbox is active
- Provided different YouTube videos for recipes
- Indented text so that the input cursor will start at the beginning of the placeholder text
- Modified border of active inputs to be red using the :focus pseudo-class. Removed the white outline added to it.
- Hid the calendar icon of the date time-local input while maintaining its functionality. An image of a different calendar was placed on top, thereby changing the appearance but keeping the function.
